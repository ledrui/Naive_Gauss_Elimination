Naive_Gauss_Elimination
=======================

I was in need of Naive Gaussian Elimination code, I Google all I found was using too complicated algorithm,
so write mine from scrach. When you'll test with Vandermonde matrix , 
the program will crash when the size of the matrix hit 14. 
That's because Vandermonde matrix is an ill-conditioned system.
